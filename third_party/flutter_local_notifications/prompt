I am building a Flutter app called "Hydro Homie".

Goal:
A personal hydration tracker that replaces the HydroCoach app. The app should be simple, offline-first, and use a clean, modular architecture.

Tech stack:
- Flutter
- Dart
- State management: Provider (ChangeNotifier)
- Local storage: shared_preferences
- Local notifications: flutter_local_notifications (Android focus)
- Target platform: Android only for now

Non-functional preferences:
- No comments in the generated code.
- Clean, readable, strongly typed Dart.
- Small focused classes instead of god objects.

App requirements:

1) Hydration tracking
- Track daily water intake in milliliters.
- User can set a custom daily hydration goal (e.g. 2500 ml).
- Show current daily progress as absolute value and percentage.
- Show a simple "traffic light" system for hydration level:
  - red: low hydration (e.g. < 40%)
  - yellow: medium hydration
  - green: goal reached or above
- Persist today's intake locally so it survives app restarts.

2) Drinks and logging
- User can log different drink types with different default sizes (e.g. water 250 ml, tea 200 ml, etc.).
- Ability to define custom drink sizes in the future (design for extensibility).
- Show favorite drink types at the top of the list.
- Logging a drink should be possible with a single tap for common sizes.

3) Reminders and notifications
- Periodic drink reminder via local notification.
- Notification must:
  - be visible on the lock screen
  - appear in the notification shade
  - when tapped, open the app directly to the drink logging screen
- Optional future extension: log a drink directly from the notification action.

4) Persistent status notification (optional / later):
- Option to show a persistent notification (ongoing) with the current hydration status.
- For example: "1500 / 2500 ml • 60% • yellow".
- Tapping this notification also opens the main screen.

Architecture goals:
- Feature-based folder structure.
- Separate layers: domain, application (state), infrastructure (storage, notifications), presentation (UI).
- Keep all hydration-related logic inside a "hydration" feature module.

Please:
1. Propose a folder structure under lib/ for this app.
2. Define the key domain models (e.g. DrinkType, DrinkEntry, AppSettings, HydrationStatus).
3. Define a HydrationState (ChangeNotifier) or similar that:
   - holds the current settings and today's entries
   - calculates daily total, percentage and traffic-light status
   - knows how to add a drink, reset today, and change the daily target
   - interacts with repositories for storage
4. Define repository interfaces and simple implementations using shared_preferences for:
   - app settings
   - today's drink entries (by date key)
5. Sketch the main UI structure:
   - Home screen with:
     - progress (text + bar)
     - hydration traffic light state
     - list of today's drinks
     - buttons for quick-logging favorite drinks
   - a simple settings screen for changing the daily target (and later reminder interval).
6. Provide the main.dart wiring:
   - create repositories
   - create HydrationState
   - wrap MaterialApp in ChangeNotifierProvider
   - set HomePage as the start screen.

Start by writing the folder structure and the core Dart classes and state wiring. Remember: no comments in the code. Focus on the architecture and clean separation of responsibilities, not UI polishing.
